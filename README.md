# Rhyne Flight Replay — research fork

Native replay additions: persistent THR %, separately labeled CAS, preserved Home
altitude, and timestamp-correct sparse playback. See [changes and build instructions](REPLAY_TELEMETRY.md).

This independent build is based on Hawkeye v0.3.0. It is not affiliated with,
authorized by, sponsored by, or approved by Hawkeye, PX4, or the Dronecode
Foundation. The upstream installation commands below install the official app,
not this fork. Build this branch for the added native replay features.

# Hawkeye

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/PX4/Hawkeye)](https://github.com/PX4/Hawkeye/releases/latest)

Real-time 3D flight visualizer for PX4 — watch live SITL simulations, replay ULog flights, and analyze multi-drone swarms with correlation tracking, takeoff alignment, and deconfliction. Supports up to 16 vehicles simultaneously with ghost overlays, formation views, and frame-by-frame inspection.

Built with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/). Zero dependencies to install — just build and fly.
